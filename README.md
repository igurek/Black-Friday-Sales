# Black-Friday-Sales

A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month.
The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month.

Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.

## I discovered useful insights within this dataset:
The most purchases were made by men in the 30-40 age range. This suggests that men in this age range are more likely to shop on Black Friday than other demographic groups. There is a positive correlation between purchase amount and product category, which means that as the product category increases, so does the purchase amount. This suggests that some product categories are more popular than others on Black Friday. The product category with the highest average purchase amount is product category 1. This suggests that product category 1 is a popular product category on Black Friday.
